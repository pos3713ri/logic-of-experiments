    "text": "1.1 Potential Outcomes\nIn this chapter, we define the average treatment effect or the ATE. This is the key quantity of interest that we want to estimate with an experiment. But to define (and understand) the ATE, we need to define several preliminary concepts.\nThe fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can never observe what would have happened to the same individual if we had instead assigned them to a different condition. We can observe the outcome under—at most—one condition.\nTo formalize this, we use the potential outcomes framework.\nFor each individual \\(i\\) in our study, we define two potential outcomes:\nThese are called “potential” outcomes because we can observe no more than one of them for any given individual. If individual \\(i\\) receives treatment, we observe \\(Y_i(1)\\) but not \\(Y_i(0)\\). If individual \\(i\\) is in control, we observe \\(Y_i(0)\\) but not \\(Y_i(1)\\).\nThe unobserved potential outcome for each individual is called the counterfactual. The counterfactual represents what would have happened in the hypothetical scenario in which the individual was assigned to a different condition.\nTo make this concrete, consider a hypothetical experiment with 10 respondents. The table below shows both potential outcomes for each respondent—something we could never actually observe in reality, but which helps us understand the framework:\nImportantly, though, we cannot observe both potential outcomes. But for now, let’s ignore that difficulty.",

Let’s define the average treatment effect or ATE, defined as\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{ATE} &= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} [Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i(1) - \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i(0) \\\\\n&= \\text{avg} \\left( Y_i(1) \\right) - \\text{avg} \\left( Y_i(0) \\right) \\\\\n&= \\text{avg. of ALL p.o. under treatment } - \\text{avg. of ALL p.o. under control}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe ATE represents the average causal effect of treatment across all individuals in the population. It tells us: on average, how much does treatment change outcomes?\nHere’s another way to think about. Suppose we assigned everyone to treatment and computed the average outcome. Suppose we also assigned everyone to control and computed the average outcome. (We can’t assign everyone to treatment and everyone to control, but suppose we could). The ATE is the difference between this two average.\nAgain, we cannot observe the ATE, but it turns out that this quantity can be estimated. In later sections, we’ll show how we can use randomized experiments to estimate the ATE. But for now, let’s focus on the meaning of the concept.\nTo make this concrete, we can compute the ATE for the potential outcomes above.\n\n\n\nRespondent\n\\(Y_i(0)\\)\n\\(Y_i(1)\\)\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n7\n\n\n2\n6\n5\n\n\n3\n5\n5\n\n\n4\n3\n9\n\n\n5\n7\n10\n\n\n6\n5\n4\n\n\n7\n4\n8\n\n\n8\n6\n7\n\n\n9\n5\n3\n\n\n10\n4\n6\n\n\n\nUsing this table, we can compute the ATE by finding the average of all potential outcomes under control and the average of all potential outcomes under treatment:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{ATE} &= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i(1) - \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i(0) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{10}(7 + 5 + 5 + 9 + 10 + 4 + 8 + 7 + 3 + 6) - \\frac{1}{10}(4 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 4) \\\\\n&= \\frac{64}{10} - \\frac{49}{10} \\\\\n&= 6.4 - 4.9 \\\\\n&= 1.5\n\\end{align}\n\\] The ATE is 1.5, meaning that on average, treatment increases outcomes by 1.5 units.

    "text": "1.4 Special Cases\n\n1.4.1 The Sharp Null Hypothesis\nThe sharp null hypothesis is a particularly strong claim about individual treatment effects. The sharp null hypothesis states that\n\\[\\text{sharp null hypothesis}: Y_i(1) = Y_i(0) \\text{ for all } i.\\]\nThis hypothesis states that treatment has exactly zero effect for every single individual in the study. That is, for each individual in the experiment, the outcome is identical regardless of whether it is assigned to treatment or control. Under the sharp null, the treatment effect \\(\\tau_i = 0\\) for all \\(i\\).\nThis hypothesis is helpful because it completely specifies all potential outcomes. If we assume the sharp null hypothesis holds, then we can compute the counterfactual outcome from the observed outcome.\n\nSuppose we observe \\(Y_i(0)\\) for a control individual, we know that \\(Y_i(1) = Y_i(0)\\).\nSimilarly, suppose we observe \\(Y_i(1)\\) for a treated individual, we know that \\(Y_i(0) = Y_i(1)\\).\n\nWhile we never know whether the sharp null hypothesis holds—and it seems implausible that it ever would hold—it can sometimes be convenient to check what would happen if it did hold.\nThe table below shows a set of potential outcomes where the sharp null holds.\n\n\n\nRespondent\n\\(Y_i(0)\\)\n\\(Y_i(1)\\)\n\\(\\tau_i\\)\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n4\n4 - 4 = 0\n\n\n2\n6\n6\n6 - 6 = 0\n\n\n3\n5\n5\n5 - 5 = 0\n\n\n4\n3\n3\n3 - 3 = 0\n\n\n5\n7\n7\n7 - 7 = 0\n\n\n6\n5\n5\n5 - 5 = 0\n\n\n7\n4\n4\n4 - 4 = 0\n\n\n8\n6\n6\n6 - 6 = 0\n\n\n9\n5\n5\n5 - 5 = 0\n\n\n10\n4\n4\n4 - 4 = 0\n\n\n\nUnder the sharp null hypothesis, \\(Y_i(1) = Y_i(0)\\) for all individuals \\(i\\), which means \\(\\tau_i = 0\\) for all individuals. We can verify this by computing the ATE:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{ATE} &= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i(1) - \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i(0) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{10}(4 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 4) - \\frac{1}{10}(4 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 4) \\\\\n&= \\frac{49}{10} - \\frac{49}{10} \\\\\n&= 4.9 - 4.9 \\\\\n&= 0\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe ATE is exactly 0. This follows from the fact that all of the individual-level effects are exactly zero as well.\n\n\n1.4.2 Constant Treatment Effects\nAnother implausible but sometimes-helpful hypothesis is the constant treatment effects assumption that\n\\[\\tau_i = \\tau \\text{ for all individuals } i\\]\nThis assumes that while the individual-level treatment effect may be different from zero, that effect is exactly the same for every individual so that \\[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) = \\tau \\text{ for all } i\\]. Here, \\(\\tau\\) is a fixed number like 2 or -4.2 that is the same for all the individuals.\nAs before, we never know whether individual-level treatment effects are constant—and it seems implausible they ever would be. But it can sometimes be convenient to check what would happen if they were constant.\nSimilar to the sharp null hypothesis, the constant effects hypothesis is helpful because it completely specifies all potential outcomes. It allows us to compute the counterfactual outcome from the observed outcome.\n\nSuppose we observe \\(Y_i(0)\\) for a control individual, we know that \\(Y_i(1)\\) is 2 points larger than that so that \\(Y_i(1) = Y_i(0) + 2\\).\nSimilarly, suppose we observe \\(Y_i(1)\\) for a treated individual, we know that \\(Y_i(0)\\) is 2 points less than that so that \\(Y_i(0) = Y_i(1) - 2\\).\n\nThe table below shows a set of potential outcomes where treatment effects are constant at \\(\\tau = 2\\) for all individuals.\n\n\n\nRespondent\n\\(Y_i(0)\\)\n\\(Y_i(1)\\)\n\\(\\tau_i\\)\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n6\n6 - 4 = 2\n\n\n2\n6\n8\n8 - 6 = 2\n\n\n3\n5\n7\n7 - 5 = 2\n\n\n4\n3\n5\n5 - 3 = 2\n\n\n5\n7\n9\n9 - 7 = 2\n\n\n6\n5\n7\n7 - 5 = 2\n\n\n7\n4\n6\n6 - 4 = 2\n\n\n8\n6\n8\n8 - 6 = 2\n\n\n9\n5\n7\n7 - 5 = 2\n\n\n10\n4\n6\n6 - 4 = 2\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{ATE} &= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i(1) - \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i(0) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{10}(6 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 6) - \\frac{1}{10}(4 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 4) \\\\\n&= \\frac{69}{10} - \\frac{49}{10} \\\\\n&= 6.9 - 4.9 \\\\\n&= 2\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe ATE is exactly 2. This follows from the fact that all of the individual-level effects are exactly 2 as well. When treatment effects are constant, the ATE perfectly captures the treatment effect for every individual.",

    "text": "1.5 Rasinski’s Question-Wording Experiment\nIn a famous survey experiment, Rasinski (1989) was curious about how question wording affects public support for government spending.1\n1 Respondents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions that asked about spending on programs for low-income individuals, but used different labels to describe these programs. The experiment was conducted across three years (1984, 1985, and 1986) and consistently found that far more respondents said the government was spending “too little” when the program was described as “assistance to the poor” (around 63-65%) compared to when it was described as “welfare” (around 20-25%). This represents a dramatic difference of approximately 40 percentage points due solely to the choice of label used to describe the same underlying government program.Respondents could be assigned to one of two conditions: treatment or control. The two conditions featured an identical question stem, but varied in how they describe the spending.\nQuestion stem (identical for both conditions): “Are we spending too much, too little, or about the right amount on…”\nTreatment condition: “…assistance to the poor?”\nControl condition: “…welfare?”\nResponse options:\n\nToo little = 1\nAbout right = 2\nToo much = 3\n\nThus each respondent had two potential outcomes:\n\n\\(Y_i(1)\\): the response respondent \\(i\\) would give if assigned to the treatment condition (“assistance to the poor”)\n\\(Y_i(0)\\): the response respondent \\(i\\) would give if assigned to the control condition (“welfare”)\n\nAs before, we can never observe both potential outcomes for the same respondent. We can observe their response if the program is described as “assistance to the poor” or as “welfare”, but not both.\n\n1.5.1 Hypothetical Potential Outcomes\nTo illustrate the concepts, suppose we could magically observe both potential outcomes for a sample of 10 respondents. The table below shows what each respondent would answer under each condition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRespondent\n\\(Y_i(0)\\) (“welfare”)\n\\(Y_i(1)\\) (“assistance”)\n\\(\\tau_i\\)\n\n\n\n\n1\n3 (Too much)\n1 (Too little)\n1 - 3 = -2\n\n\n2\n3 (Too much)\n2 (About right)\n2 - 3 = -1\n\n\n3\n2 (About right)\n1 (Too little)\n1 - 2 = -1\n\n\n4\n3 (Too much)\n1 (Too little)\n1 - 3 = -2\n\n\n5\n2 (About right)\n1 (Too little)\n1 - 2 = -1\n\n\n6\n3 (Too much)\n2 (About right)\n2 - 3 = -1\n\n\n7\n2 (About right)\n1 (Too little)\n1 - 2 = -1\n\n\n8\n3 (Too much)\n1 (Too little)\n1 - 3 = -2\n\n\n9\n2 (About right)\n2 (About right)\n2 - 2 = 0\n\n\n10\n3 (Too much)\n1 (Too little)\n1 - 3 = -2\n\n\n\nNotice that for most respondents, the treatment effect \\(\\tau_i\\) is negative. This means that asking about “assistance to the poor” produces lower numeric responses than asking about “welfare.” In this case, lower numbers indicate more support for spending (“too little” = 1), these negative treatment effects actually represent increased support for spending when using the “assistance to the poor” wording.\n\n\n1.5.2 Computing the ATE\nWe can compute the ATE for this hypothetical data:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{ATE} &= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i(1) - \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i(0) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{10}(1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1) - \\frac{1}{10}(3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3) \\\\\n&= \\frac{13}{10} - \\frac{26}{10} \\\\\n&= 1.3 - 2.6 \\\\\n&= -1.3\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe ATE is -1.3. Since lower values on our 1-2-3 scale indicate more support for spending, this negative ATE means that the “assistance to the poor” wording increases support for spending by an average of 1.3 scale points compared to the “welfare” wording.",

What stays the same?\nWhy might the word “welfare” produce different responses than “assistance to the poor” even though both refer to the same government programs?\n\nInterpreting Rasinski’s Results: In the hypothetical Rasinski data presented in the notes, the ATE was -1.3.\n\nExplain what this negative ATE means substantively. Does it indicate increased or decreased support for spending?\nWhy is the sign (positive or negative) of the ATE potentially confusing in this example?\nIf we had instead coded responses as: Too little = 3, About right = 2, Too much = 1, what would the ATE have been? Would your substantive interpretation change?\n\nRasinski’s Potential Outcomes: Consider respondent 9 in the hypothetical Rasinski data, who answered “About right” (2) under both conditions.\n\nWhat is this respondent’s individual treatment effect (\\(\\tau_9\\))?\nDoes this mean the question wording had no effect on this respondent?
